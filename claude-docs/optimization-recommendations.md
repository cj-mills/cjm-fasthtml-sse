# cjm-fasthtml-sse Library Optimization Recommendations

This document outlines key optimizations and enhancements recommended for the `cjm-fasthtml-sse` library based on analysis of real-world use cases, particularly the job queue example with cross-tab synchronization.

## 1. Topic/Channel Support

### Current Limitation
The library currently broadcasts to all connected clients without built-in support for topic-based subscriptions.

### Proposed Enhancement
Add support for channel/topic-based broadcasting where clients can subscribe to specific topics:

```python
# Server-side: Topic-based route
@sse.topic_route("/updates/{topic}")
async def topic_updates(topic: str):
    return lambda msg: msg.metadata.get("topic") == topic

# Broadcasting to specific topic
await sse.broadcast(
    "update", 
    data, 
    topic="jobs",  # Only clients subscribed to "jobs" topic receive this
    metadata={"topic": "jobs", "priority": "high"}
)

# Client-side: Subscribe to specific topic
<div hx-ext="sse" sse-connect="/updates/jobs" sse-swap="message">
```

### Benefits
- Reduced network traffic
- More efficient client-side processing
- Better scalability for applications with multiple data streams

## 2. Enhanced Message Filtering

### Current Limitation
Basic message filtering exists but lacks sophisticated client-specific and conditional broadcasting capabilities.

### Proposed Enhancement
Implement multi-level filtering with client metadata and message content filters:

```python
# Client-specific filtering based on metadata
await sse.broadcast(
    "update", 
    data,
    filters=[
        lambda client: client.metadata.get("role") == "admin",
        lambda client: client.metadata.get("permissions", []).includes("view_sensitive"),
        lambda msg: msg.data.get("priority") == "high"
    ]
)

# Register clients with metadata
@sse.sse_route("/stream")
async def stream(user_role: str, permissions: list):
    return SSEConnection(
        manager=sse.manager,
        metadata={
            "role": user_role,
            "permissions": permissions,
            "connected_at": datetime.now()
        }
    )
```

### Benefits
- Role-based access control for SSE streams
- Reduced server load by filtering at broadcast time
- Better security and privacy control

## 3. State Synchronization Helpers

### Current Limitation
New connections joining an existing stream don't automatically receive the current state, requiring manual implementation.

### Proposed Enhancement
Add built-in state synchronization for late-joining clients:

```python
# Stateful route with automatic initial state sync
@sse.stateful_route("/dashboard", state_provider=get_dashboard_state)
async def dashboard_stream():
    # New connections automatically receive current state
    # Then receive incremental updates
    pass

async def get_dashboard_state():
    """Provide current state for new connections"""
    return {
        "active_jobs": monitor.all(),
        "statistics": calculate_stats(),
        "last_update": datetime.now()
    }

# Configure catch-up behavior
@sse.stateful_route(
    "/live-data",
    catch_up_mode="last_n",  # or "time_window", "full_history"
    catch_up_count=10  # Last 10 messages
)
async def live_data_stream():
    pass
```

### Benefits
- Seamless experience for users opening new tabs
- Consistent state across all connected clients
- Reduced complexity in application code

## 4. More Complex Real-World Examples

### Current Limitation
Examples focus on simple use cases; complex patterns aren't well documented.

### Proposed Examples

#### Multi-User Chat Application
```python
# Complete example showing:
# - User authentication and metadata
# - Private messages (user-to-user filtering)
# - Room-based channels
# - Message history for new connections
# - Typing indicators
# - Read receipts
```

#### Live Dashboard with Multiple Data Streams
```python
# Example demonstrating:
# - Multiple SSE endpoints for different metrics
# - Aggregated updates with throttling
# - Chart/graph real-time updates
# - Performance optimization for high-frequency updates
# - Graceful degradation for slow connections
```

#### File Upload Progress Tracking
```python
# Show implementation of:
# - Per-file progress streams
# - Multiple concurrent uploads
# - Cancellation handling
# - Error recovery
# - Bandwidth throttling awareness
```

## 5. Robust Error Handling

### Current Limitation
Basic error handling exists but could be more comprehensive for production use.

### Proposed Enhancement

#### Network Failure Recovery
```python
# Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
@sse.resilient_route(
    "/critical-stream",
    max_retries=5,
    backoff_factor=2,
    max_backoff=30
)
async def critical_stream():
    pass

# Client notification of connection issues
class ConnectionHealthMonitor:
    async def check_health(self, connection):
        if connection.latency > threshold:
            await self.notify_slow_connection(connection)
        if connection.missed_heartbeats > max_missed:
            await self.initiate_reconnection(connection)
```

#### Memory Management
```python
# Automatic cleanup of stale connections
@sse.managed_route(
    "/data",
    max_queue_size=1000,
    overflow_policy="drop_oldest",  # or "drop_newest", "block"
    idle_timeout=300  # Disconnect after 5 min idle
)
async def data_stream():
    pass

# Resource monitoring
class ResourceMonitor:
    async def monitor_connections(self):
        for conn in self.connections:
            if conn.queue_size > threshold:
                await self.apply_backpressure(conn)
            if self.total_memory > limit:
                await self.shed_connections(strategy="oldest")
```

#### Graceful Degradation
```python
# Fallback to polling when SSE unavailable
@sse.with_fallback(
    polling_interval=5,
    fallback_endpoint="/api/poll"
)
async def updates_stream():
    pass

# Automatic quality adjustment
class AdaptiveStreaming:
    async def adjust_quality(self, connection):
        if connection.bandwidth < threshold:
            connection.throttle_rate = "low"
            connection.update_frequency = "reduced"
```

## 6. Performance Optimizations

### Message Batching
```python
# Batch multiple updates for efficiency
@sse.batched_route(
    "/high-frequency",
    batch_interval=0.1,  # 100ms batching window
    max_batch_size=50
)
async def high_frequency_stream():
    pass
```

### Compression Support
```python
# Enable compression for large payloads
@sse.compressed_route(
    "/large-data",
    compression="gzip",
    min_size=1024  # Only compress if > 1KB
)
async def large_data_stream():
    pass
```

## 7. Developer Experience Improvements

### Debugging Tools
```python
# SSE stream inspector for development
if debug_mode:
    app.mount("/sse-debug", SSEDebugPanel(sse))

# Stream replay for testing
@sse.recordable_route("/events")
async def events_stream():
    # Automatically records stream for replay in tests
    pass
```

### Type Hints and Validation
```python
from typing import TypedDict

class JobUpdate(TypedDict):
    job_id: str
    status: Literal["running", "completed", "failed"]
    progress: float

@sse.typed_route("/jobs", response_model=JobUpdate)
async def jobs_stream() -> AsyncIterator[JobUpdate]:
    # Type-safe SSE streams with validation
    pass
```

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority** (Core functionality gaps)
   - Topic/Channel Support
   - Enhanced Message Filtering
   - State Synchronization Helpers

2. **Medium Priority** (Production readiness)
   - Robust Error Handling
   - Memory Management
   - Performance Optimizations

3. **Low Priority** (Nice to have)
   - Complex Examples
   - Debugging Tools
   - Advanced Type Support

## Notes

These recommendations are based on analysis of real-world SSE usage patterns, particularly from complex applications like the job queue manager with cross-tab synchronization. Implementation should focus on maintaining the library's clean API design while adding these capabilities in a backward-compatible manner.
